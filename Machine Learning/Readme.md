# Machine Learning model

Team member: Arpad Fodor



This is the Machine Learning repository of creating a model which classifies dog & cat breeds, and humans. The model itself is based on a Convolutional Neural Network. 



- The model building and training procedure can be found in the CNN Notebook, which is in the root directory.
- Find the data preparation process in /data subfolder. Note that the dataset itself is not uploaded due to its size, but image samples has been uploaded.
- Find models in the /saved subfolder, which contains the previously trained models in /models and the generated TFLite models in /tflite.
- The semester summary writing can be found in the /paper directory.
